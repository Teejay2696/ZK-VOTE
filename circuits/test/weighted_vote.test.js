/**
 * Tests for the WeightedVoteBalanceProof circuit (Issue #127).
 *
 * These use the compiled witness calculator directly (rather than
 * `circom_tester`) because `circom_tester` shells out to the `circom`
 * binary with an unquoted absolute path, which breaks on checkouts whose
 * path contains a space (this repo is cloned under a directory containing
 * a literal space). Invoking the generated `witness_calculator.js` in
 * process sidesteps that shell-quoting issue entirely while still
 * exercising the real compiled circuit.
 *
 * Run `npm run compile:weighted-vote` (see package.json) before running
 * this test file if `build/weighted_vote/` is not present.
